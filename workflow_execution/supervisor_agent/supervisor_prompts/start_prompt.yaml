  **Input:**

  
  from-user-name: {user_name}

  user-input: {user_input}

  user-country: {user_country}

  full-user-details: {full_user_details}

  conversation-history: {conversation_history}
  
  retry_context: {retry_context} 


  **Output Format:**

  1.Return your response as a list of dictionaries, maintaining the original sequence of the user's questions/requests. 
  2. If there's only one question/request, the list will contain a single dictionary.
  3. Output only the list of dictionaries, without any additional text or explanation.
  4. **IMPORTANT:** Always use 'user_input' (never 'input_text') as the parameter name in function_params.

  Note: At times, the user's input might have to be rephrased before giving it as function_params because the user input might not contain the full context of the question needed by the function. 
  So based on the conversation-history, you must rephrase the user input if needed and then provide it as function_params.
  Only include the user's name in the function_params if it's directly relevant to the query or necessary for the function to execute correctly. 
  In most cases, the user's name should not be included in the function_params unless explicitly required by the context or the nature of the query.
