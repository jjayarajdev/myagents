      #### General SQL Query Guidelines
      **Column Naming:**
        - Always enclose column names within the SQL statement using **double quotes**.
        - Use exact column names as provided in the schema. If necessary, use aliases by following the column name with `AS` (e.g., `PROPERTY_NB AS PropertyNumber`).
      **String Matching:**
        - For text/string `WHERE` clauses, employ **fuzzy matching** using `ilike '%keyword%'` for case-insensitive pattern matching.

      **Column Reference Restrictions:**
        - Only use the provided column names from the given tables and schemas; do not create or assume columns that are not explicitly mentioned.

      **Ambiguous Column Names:**
        - Avoid ambiguous column names by qualifying them with the appropriate table alias, especially when joining multiple tables.

      **Numerical Variable Naming:**
        - Do not include or generate numerical values at the beginning of SQL variable names.

      **Date Handling:** 
        - For date columns, always cast dates using: `TO_CHAR(::TIMESTAMP_NTZ, 'DD-Mon-YYYY').

      **Null Value Filtering:**
        - Always filter out null values by adding conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

      
      **Commenting:**
        - Do not add comments in between the generated query.

      #### Error Handling & Additional Notes

      **Handling Division Scenarios:**
          - **Check for Zero Denominator**: Use conditional statements to check if the denominator is zero before division.
          - **Utilize NULLIF Function**: Apply NULLIF to handle zero denominators, returning NULL instead of causing an error.
          - **Filter Out Zero Values**: Include conditions in the `WHERE` clause to exclude records where the denominator is zero.
          - **Provide Default Values**: Use functions like COALESCE to assign default values when applicable.

      **Handling Unsupported Subquery Types:**
          - **Review Query Structure**: Evaluate the query to identify complex or nested subqueries.
          - **Flatten Subqueries**: Rewrite nested subqueries as joins or CTEs.
          - **Utilize CTEs**: Consider using CTEs for manageable parts of complex queries.

      **Handling Invalid Identifier Errors:**
          - **Check Spelling and Case Sensitivity**: Verify that identifiers are spelled correctly and match database case.
          - **Confirm Identifier Existence**: Ensure identifiers exist in the specified table or view.
          - **Review Alias Usage**: Ensure aliases are defined correctly and referenced appropriately.
          - **Examine Context**: Check the context of identifier usage in the query.
          - **Use Fully Qualified Names**: Consider using fully qualified names to eliminate ambiguity.

      **Handling Single-row Subquery Errors:**
          - **Single-row Subquery Returns More than One Row**: Ensure that subqueries expected to return a single row are constructed correctly. Use aggregate functions (e.g., `MAX`, `MIN`) or filter conditions to guarantee that only one row is returned.

      #### Query Construction Techniques

      17. **Filtering Data:**
          - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on specific conditions, ensuring the exact column names are used. For date filters, ensure compatibility with the `TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9)` data type.

      18. **Sorting Data:**
          - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the result set, specifying column names and sort direction (ASC or DESC).

      19. **Joins:**
          - Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, or `FULL JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables. Specify the join condition in the `ON` clause.

      20. **Grouping Data:**
          - Use the `GROUP BY` clause for grouping data based on columns, followed by aggregate functions (e.g., `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`).

      21. **Aggregating Data:**
          - Use aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX`. Ensure the use of `GROUP BY` when aggregating data.

      22. **Using Aliases:**
          - Use column aliases for readability (e.g., `COUNTRY_T AS Country`) and table aliases in joins for clarity (e.g., `property AS p`).

      23. **Handling Complex Queries:**
          - For subqueries, enclose them in parentheses. Use the `WITH` clause (Common Table Expressions) for temporary result sets.

      24. **Combining Results:**
          - Use `UNION` or `UNION ALL` to combine results from multiple queries, ensuring compatibility in the number of columns and data types.

      25. **Conditional Logic:**
          - Use `CASE` statements for conditional logic to create derived columns based on specific conditions.

      26. **Limiting Results:**
          - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of rows returned.

      27. **Table Aliasing:**
          - Always use table or CTE aliases when selecting columns, especially when joining multiple tables or CTEs (e.g., instead of "Year", use t1."Year").

      28. **Fully Qualifying Column Names:**
          - Prefix column names with the table or CTE name when referencing them (e.g., `table_name.column_name`).

      29. **Avoiding Common Names:**
          - Be cautious with commonly used column names like ID, Date, Year, and rename them if necessary using aliases.

      30. **Descriptive Aliases:**
          - Use descriptive aliases that convey the purpose of the data (e.g., instead of `AS "Value"`, use `AS "Total_Sales_Value"`).

      31. **Checking for Overlaps in Joins:**
          - Review joins to ensure that columns with the same name from different tables are explicitly referenced.

      32. **Explicitly Reference Grouped Columns:**
          - In `GROUP BY` clauses, include the full column specification (e.g., `t."Year"`).

      ### Special Note for alias:
          - **Avoid Self-Reference**: Do not reference an alias in the same level of the query where it is defined. Instead, use the original column name. This prevents errors related to undefined identifiers.
