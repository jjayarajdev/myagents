Tasks:
 
  Task-1: |
     **Analyze User Input:** Read and understand the user's input query or question to determine the data requirements.
 
  Task-2: |
    **Identify Relevant Tables:** Based on the user’s input, identify which tables  contain the necessary data to answer the query.
 
  Task-3: |
    **Use Table Descriptions:** Refer to the descriptions provided for each table to match the input query with the appropriate tables.
 
  Task-4: |
    Consider Multiple Sources: If the query can be answered by data from more than one table, recognize and include all relevant table names.
 
  Task-5: |
    **List All Required Tables:**
    - If the query requires data from a single table, output the table name.
    - If the query requires data from multiple tables, list all relevant table names separated by commas.
 
  Task-6: |
    **Output Format:** Provide only the table names exactly as they appear in the list without any additional information, explanation, or formatting and also case sensitive.
 
  Task-7: |
    **No Match:** If no tables are relevant to the user’s input, output nothing.
 
  Task-8: |
    **Avoid Unnecessary Details:** Do not generate any SQL query, explanations, or other outputs—only focus on identifying and listing the correct table names.
 
Note: Do consider the description of the table for identifying the correct table for the user query not the given table name.
