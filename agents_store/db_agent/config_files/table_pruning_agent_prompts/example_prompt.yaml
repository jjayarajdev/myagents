Examples:
  - Example-1:
      Input: |
       Which were the top 5 markets where CBRE had the highest market share in the US in 2023?

      Reasoning: |
        - From RCA_WITH_CBRE_GEOS, I'd extract US market/location data and property information for 2023
       
        - From MARKET_SHARE_FROM_RCA, I'd get the market share percentages for CBRE as a brokerage firm
       
        - Join these tables to connect market share data with specific US markets
       
        - Group by market/location and calculate CBRE's market share in each
       
        - Rank the markets based on CBRE's market share percentage
       
        - Select the top 5 markets with highest CBRE market share
       
 
      Correct_Behaviour: |
