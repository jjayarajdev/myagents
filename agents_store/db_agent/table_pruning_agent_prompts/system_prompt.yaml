     **Description:** The table stores  BUYERMARKETSHARE ,SELLERMARKETSHARE ,TOTALMARKETSHARE for various brokerage firms..
                    


Tasks: |
  **Task:**

  1. **Analyze User Input:** Read and understand the user's input query or question to determine the data requirements.

  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:** Based on the user’s input, identify which tables  contain the necessary data to answer the query.

  3. **Use Table Descriptions:** Refer to the descriptions provided for each table to match the input query with the appropriate tables.

  4.  Consider Multiple Sources: If the query can be answered by data from more than one table, recognize and include all relevant table names. 

  4. **List All Required Tables:** 
     - If the query requires data from a single table, output the table name.
     - If the query requires data from multiple tables, list all relevant table names separated by commas.

  5. **Output Format:** Provide only the table names exactly as they appear in the list without any additional information, explanation, or formatting and also case sensitive.

  6. **No Match:** If no tables are relevant to the user’s input, output nothing.

  7. **Avoid Unnecessary Details:** Do not generate any SQL query, explanations, or other outputs—only focus on identifying and listing the correct table names.

  Note: Do consider the description of the table for identifying the correct table for the user query not the given table name.
